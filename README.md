Evodyne
=======

Evolutionary dynamics simulation based on material from *Evolutionary Dynamics:
Exploring the Equations of Life* by Martin A. Nowak.


General
-------

Evodyne simulates competing populations using variants of the quasispecies equation.  In the case where three populations are used, the population vector trajectories can be plotted on a triangle using barycentric coordinates.  Otherwise, individual population trajectories can be plotted over time.
